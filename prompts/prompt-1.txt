"Day Zero Portfolio Management: 2023-02-24:

I'm initiating the trade day simulation with the upload of 'all_fund_prices-49-72.csv' for Day Zero, corresponding to the date 2023-02-24. We begin managing a portfolio of 8-14 diversified funds with an initial capital of 1 million Turkish Lira, focusing on performance, volatility, sector diversity, and macro-economic considerations.

Process for Day Zero:

Data Analysis: Analyze 'all_fund_prices-49-72.csv', focusing on funds with at least 12 weeks of history, disregarding those with significant missing data.
Fund Selection & Diversification Strategy: Choose funds based on performance and volatility, ensuring diversification. Aim to allocate about 70% of the portfolio to the most efficient funds in dominant sectors, diversifying the remaining 30% into different fund types like local stocks and gold.
Portfolio Formation: Form a portfolio of 8-14 funds based on the analysis and diversification strategy.
Performance Tracking & Reporting: Provide a detailed report of selected funds in the following format:
"Day Zero (2023-02-24):"
"Fund code: AOY, Fund name: ..., buy price: XXX, Current Price: XXX, Profit/Loss percentage: XXX, decision: hold/sell"
"Fund code: AFO, Fund name: ..., buy price: YYY, decision: buy"
Adaptability to Market Changes: Stay flexible and ready to adjust the strategy based on new data and macro-economic changes.
This approach will set a solid foundation for managing the portfolio through subsequent trade days."
